# Image-Processing-Tool

This is a Python program that provides various image processing functionalities using the OpenCV library. It allows users to apply filters, perform resizing, and implement other image manipulation techniques.

## Features

- Image filtering: Apply different filters like blur, sharpen, and edge detection to images.
- Image resizing: Resize images to specific dimensions or scale them proportionally.
- Image rotation: Rotate images by a specified angle.
- Image cropping: Crop images to focus on specific regions of interest.
- Image enhancement: Adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation levels.
- Image conversion: Convert images between different formats, such as JPEG, PNG, and TIFF.

## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```shell
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

2. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-processing-tool.git
   ```

3. Change into the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd image-processing-tool
   ```

4. Run the program:

   ```shell
   python image_processing_tool.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the program and follow the on-screen instructions.
2. Select the desired image processing operation from the menu.
3. Provide the necessary input parameters when prompted.
4. The processed image will be saved to the output directory.

## Examples

1. Applying a Gaussian blur filter:

   ```shell
   Select the option: 1
   Enter the path to the input image: input.jpg
   Enter the path to save the output image: output.jpg
   Enter the kernel size (odd number): 5
   ```

2. Resizing an image:

   ```shell
   Select the option: 2
   Enter the path to the input image: input.jpg
   Enter the path to save the output image: output.jpg
   Enter the target width: 800
   Enter the target height: 600
   ```
